# Welcome to your Rork app

## This fork / branch

This is `CodeNewb13`'s fork of [`ktimothybudi-source/DietKu`](https://github.com/ktimothybudi-source/DietKu). The `local-dev-and-supabase-fixes` branch fixes a set of local-development and Supabase issues found while getting the app running from scratch:

- **Gemini as a local AI provider** (`backend/lib/meal-analysis-service.ts`, `backend/hono-ai.ts`): meal-photo scanning can now route through Google's OpenAI-compatible Gemini endpoint via `AI_PROVIDER=gemini` in `.env`, so local development doesn't require an OpenAI API key. Production still defaults to OpenAI.
- **Dev-only admin sign-in shortcut** (`app/_layout.tsx`, `lib/devSkip.ts`): on the web preview, pressing backtick (`` ` ``) three times signs into a real Supabase account (configured via `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`PASSWORD` in `.env`) instead of just bypassing the auth redirect with no session, which previously left the dashboard stuck loading with an empty profile.
- **Fixed 11 migration files with duplicate date-only version prefixes** (e.g. three separate files all named `20260309_*.sql`) that made `supabase db push` unable to track them as distinct versions and crash partway through a full push. See `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Fixed a migration missing a `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` guard** (`20260521_community_group_name_member_update.sql`) that every other RLS migration in this repo already had.
- **Added a migration to create the `meal-photos` Storage bucket + RLS policies** (`20260913_create_meal_photos_bucket.sql`). This bucket previously existed only as a manual step someone took in the Supabase Dashboard and was never captured as a migration — so on a freshly-provisioned Supabase project (e.g. after the original project was reset), every meal-photo save failed with no bucket to upload to.
- Reorganized root-level docs/scripts into `docs/` and `scripts/` (no functional change).

**Deploying these changes to production:** production infra (the `dietku.onrender.com` backend, the EAS project, and the App Store/Play Store listings) is owned by accounts under `ktimothybudi-source` / `timothykurniawan2`, not this fork. Merging this branch upstream requires a pull request reviewed and merged by the upstream repo owner; actually deploying (Render redeploy, `eas build`/`eas submit`) additionally requires access to those specific accounts, which this fork does not have on its own.

## Project info

This is a native cross-platform mobile app created with [Rork](https://rork.com)

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use Rork**

Simply visit [rork.com](https://rork.com) and prompt to build your app with AI.

Changes made via Rork will be committed automatically to this GitHub repo.

Whenever you make a change in your local code editor and push it to GitHub, it will be also reflected in Rork.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Rork.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Recommended)**

1. **iOS**: Download the [Rork app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/rork) or [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
2. **Android**: Download the [Expo Go app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
3. Run `bun run start` and scan the QR code from your development server

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

You can test Rork apps in Expo Go or Rork iOS app. You don't need XCode or Android Studio for most features.

**When do you need Custom Development Builds?**

- Native authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Push notifications
- Custom native modules

### **Creating a Custom Development Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```
